# Things to remember - Don't procastinate! (We can't afford it)
1. Run the "./build" command at the project level to build both - your backend and frontend projects and update your local database. (you can use the "cd .." command multiple times and you will land up there eventually. It is the directory which contains both the frontend and backend projects.)
2. You can run the "./frontendbuild" command to install dependent npm packages and run your frontend project all in the same command. 
3. Do not ever commit the package-lock.json file. It will automatically be generated when you run the npm start function on the front-end. Make sure you remove this file before you commit any of your changes.
