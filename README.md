1. Run the ./build command at the project level to build both - your backend and frontend projects and update your local database. (you can use the "cd .." command multiple times and you will land up there eventually. It is the directory which contains both the frontend and backend projects.)
2. Do not ever commit the package-lock.json file. It will automatically be generated when you run the npm start function on the front-end. Make sure you remove this file before you commit.
